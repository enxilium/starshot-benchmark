"""Server entry that skips Trellis 2 + Nano Banana (image+mesh generation).

The full LLM pipeline still runs end-to-end — every zone and object gets
emitted as a bbox event, and the viewer renders them as wireframes. No
`.glb` files are written; no `model` events are emitted, so the client
never attempts a mesh fetch.

Bbox validation runs in production but is advisory (see divider /
generation), so this entry doesn't need to stub anything beyond the mesh
pass. Relationship validators still abort the run on cycles / unknown
targets, in this mode and every other.

Used by `scripts/run_bboxes_only.py`.
