"""Mesh post-processing: yaw rotation + rescaling into a target bbox.

Per-axis scaling: each axis is scaled independently so the mesh exactly
fills the bbox on every axis. Proportions are not preserved — the
guarantee is that the mesh is fully contained in the bbox.

Orientation contract:
  Trellis 2 returns a mesh whose intrinsic front face points along +Z
  in mesh frame. The Node's `orientation` is a yaw (integer degrees,
  right-handed about +Y) that rotates the mesh into world pose: 0 leaves
  the front facing world +Z; 90 turns the front to world -X. The
  image-prompt step requests an orthographic head-on front view so
  Trellis's output frame is predictable, leaving this rotation as the
  only orientation knob.

Order of operations: translate to origin → yaw → scale → translate to
bbox center. Yaw is applied to the unscaled mesh so it composes cleanly
with per-axis scaling.
