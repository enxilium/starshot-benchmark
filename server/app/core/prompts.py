PROXY_SHAPE_DOC = """\
A `proxy_shape` describes the silhouette of the node's mesh INSIDE its \
axis-aligned bbox. The proxy is always inscribed in the AABB; you do \
NOT emit radii or cap sizes — they derive from the bbox dimensions. \
Emit `proxy_shape` ONLY when the mesh is noticeably non-boxy; omit it \
(i.e. null / absent) when the bbox itself is a good collision proxy.

NOTATION used below. For an AABB with min corner (x_min, y_min, z_min) \
and max corner (x_max, y_max, z_max): center (cx, cy, cz), \
half-extents (hx, hy, hz) = ((x_max-x_min)/2, (y_max-y_min)/2, \
(z_max-z_min)/2), full extents (sx, sy, sz) = (2·hx, 2·hy, 2·hz). \
Every proxy below defines a FOOTPRINT (the XZ region the shape covers) \
and a TOP-SURFACE FUNCTION Y_top(x, z) that returns the proxy's upper \
surface height at a given XZ inside that footprint. There is no \
automatic correction — when you anchor another node ON this one, YOU \
must compute Y_top at the anchor's XZ and place its bbox so its \
bottom face sits there.

Valid values:

  * null / omitted — BOX. The AABB is the proxy. Default.
      WHEN TO USE: walls, floors, ceilings, furniture, crates, \
      buildings, signs, rectangular terrain slabs — anything \
      rectilinear.
      FOOTPRINT: the full AABB rectangle, x ∈ [x_min, x_max], \
      z ∈ [z_min, z_max].
      Y_top(x, z) = y_max   (flat top face everywhere in the \
      footprint).

  * SPHERE — ellipsoid inscribed in the AABB, centered at (cx, cy, \
    cz) with semi-axes (hx, hy, hz).
      WHEN TO USE: boulders, planets, balls, orbs, fruits, pumpkins, \
      beach balls.
      FOOTPRINT: the disk ((x-cx)/hx)² + ((z-cz)/hz)² ≤ 1 in the XZ \
      plane through the centre.
      Y_top(x, z) = cy + hy · √(1 − ((x-cx)/hx)² − ((z-cz)/hz)²).
      Apex: (cx, y_max, cz).

  * CAPSULE — Y-axis capsule inscribed in the AABB. Let r = \
    min(hx, hz). Axis is the vertical line through (cx, cz).
      WHEN TO USE: tree trunks, humans, pillars, lamp posts, \
      bottles — anything columnar.
      Top cap centre: (cx, y_max − r, cz). Bottom cap centre: \
      (cx, y_min + r, cz). Cylindrical section of height sy − 2r \
      between the cap centres (degenerates to a sphere when \
      sy ≤ 2r, in which case r = sy/2 instead of min(hx, hz)).
      FOOTPRINT: the disk (x-cx)² + (z-cz)² ≤ r² centered on the \
      axis — note this is generally smaller than the AABB footprint.
      Y_top(x, z) = (y_max − r) + √(r² − (x-cx)² − (z-cz)²).
      Apex: (cx, y_max, cz).

  * HEMISPHERE — upper half of an ellipsoid with its equatorial \
    disk resting on the AABB's bottom face (y = y_min) and its apex \
    at (cx, y_max, cz). Semi-axes are (hx, sy, hz) — the VERTICAL \
    half-extent is the FULL AABB height sy, NOT hy, because the \
    equator sits at y_min, not at cy.
      WHEN TO USE: DOMED TERRAIN — low islands rising from the \
      waterline, grassy mounds, half-buried boulders, snow hills, \
      cathedral domes.
      FOOTPRINT: the disk ((x-cx)/hx)² + ((z-cz)/hz)² ≤ 1 at \
      y = y_min.
      Y_top(x, z) = y_min + sy · √(1 − ((x-cx)/hx)² − ((z-cz)/hz)²).
      Drops from the apex y_max at the centre to y_min at the \
      footprint boundary.

ON-RELATIONSHIP CONSEQUENCE. When you anchor a node ON a target with \
a non-BOX proxy, the AABB's top face is NOT the resting surface. \
Compute the target's Y_top at the anchored node's XZ centre using \
the target's AABB and the formula above, then set the anchored \
node's bbox so its bottom face Y equals Y_top. Example: a 0.8m tree \
placed ON a HEMISPHERE island whose AABB is (x_min=-5, y_min=0, \
z_min=-5) → (x_max=5, y_max=1.2, z_max=5), at XZ = (3, 0), rests at \
Y_top = 0 + 1.2·√(1 − 0.36) = 0.96, so its bbox spans y ∈ [0.96, \
1.76] — NOT [1.20, 2.00]. Getting this wrong leaves the tree visibly \
floating or sunk. For BOX targets the rule collapses to the familiar \
"bottom face at y_max".\

# ---------- Step 1: zone plan (high-level authoring; runs for every zone) ---

    """\
You are authoring the HIGH-LEVEL PLAN for a region of a 3D scene \
being built for StarshotBench — a head-to-head LLM benchmark where \
your scene is rendered and judged against another LLM's rendering of \
the same user prompt. Judges weigh prompt fidelity, compositional \
coherence, recognizability, detail richness, and creativity; they see \
only the final scene, not the prompts, not the plan.

Your job is to TRANSFORM the region's prompt into a vivid, \
opinionated, concrete vision for what this region IS. The prompt is a \
seed (e.g. "a beautiful modern mansion", "a low muddy island", "the \
imperial box"). Your output is the AUTHORED VISION that makes the \
seed specific, distinctive, and memorable. A vague, template-y plan \
produces a region that reads as stock assets. A vivid, committed plan \
propagates specificity all the way to the rendered mesh — and the \
judges see the difference. Don't play it safe. Commit to a point of \
view: an adequate plan calls a region "a medium muddy island"; a \
winning plan makes it "a low hummock fringed with twisted cypress \
roots, dominated by a lone lightning-split stump that reads as the \
island's character from any angle".

If this region is the ROOT (the whole scene), this plan IS the SCENE \
PLAN — the north-star that every descendant inherits. The ROOT is a \
PURELY ABSTRACT, INTANGIBLE META-CONTAINER for the entire world — \
it has no walls, no floor, no ceiling, no surface, no skin, and \
never gets a frame, mesh, or geometry of its own. It is the canvas \
inside which the actual scene (rooms, buildings, terrain, enclosures) \
is placed as CHILD zones. If the user prompt names a single tangible \
enclosure that needs walls/floor/ceiling (a hotel room, a throne \
room, a garage, a cockpit), the ROOT is NOT that enclosure — the \
enclosure is a child zone INSIDE the root, and the root's plan \
should describe the enclosure as the singular subzone within an \
otherwise empty world canvas. If it is a NESTED region, your plan \
must stay consistent with the character your direct ancestors \
committed to (shown in the inputs) and must not contradict any \
concrete object already generated in the scene.

<what_to_write>
ONE cohesive paragraph (no headers, no lists), roughly 5-10 \
sentences, that:
  * Sets the CHARACTER — the mood, era, palette, materials, lighting \
    feel, silhouette of this region. Commit to a point of view: is \
    the mansion sun-bleached coastal modernism or brooding hillside \
    concrete? Is the island lush moss-cushioned or bleached \
    salt-crusted? The user did not pick; you do.
  * Names the FEATURES OF INTEREST that give the region its \
    identity — focal points, landmarks, anchors a viewer would point \
    at (a stone hearth, a central fountain, a writing desk, a lone \
    lightning-split stump). Be concrete about what makes each \
    distinctive.
  * For the ROOT only: also suggest the OVERALL SILHOUETTE / SHAPE \
    of the scene — tall and narrow (a skyscraper), long and flat (a \
    river), wide and shallow (a coastal vista), roughly cubic (a \
    room). This feeds directly into the next step, which sizes the \
    canvas.
</what_to_write>

<what_NOT_to_write>
  * Do NOT decide structural decomposition. Do not say "this \
    subdivides", "this is atomic", "the children are X and Y", or \
    enumerate sub-regions as a planned tree. A separate downstream \
    step (the ZONE DECOMPOSE step) makes that call using your plan \
    as input — pre-empting it cripples that step. You may describe a \
    region as containing distinct loci of character ("the grounds \
    pivot between a formal front garden and a wild rear orchard"); \
    the decomposer will read that and decide whether to subdivide.
  * Do NOT enumerate individual OBJECTS. No "a fountain", "a chair", \
    "a chandelier", "a single tree", "a red flag" as a list of \
    things to place. Object selection happens later in each atomic \
    region's generation pass — those steps need AGENCY to pick \
    objects in service of your character. You may describe the \
    character those objects will collectively express ("the imperial \
    box reads as ornate and ceremonial"), but stop short of listing \
    the props.
  * Do NOT pick coordinates, dimensions, counts, materials by brand, \
    or specific instances. Stay at the level of mood, palette, \
    identity, and silhouette.
  * Do NOT describe camera, framing, or rendering. The pipeline \
    handles those.

You are deciding the STRUCTURE of a zone in a 3D scene built for \
StarshotBench. The zone's HIGH-LEVEL PLAN was already authored by the \
upstream ZONE PLAN step and is shown to you in the inputs as the ZONE \
PLAN. Your job: decide whether this zone is ATOMIC (a leaf — its \
next level of detail is individual anchor objects, materialized later \
by the generation pipeline) or SUBDIVIDES into child zones, and if it \
subdivides, emit each child fully structured — `id`, `prompt`, \
optional `proxy_shape`, and the `relationships` that anchor it inside \
the parent. Subdivision and per-child structure are codependent (you \
cannot anchor children you have not committed to, and you cannot \
commit to children without imagining their layout), so they belong \
in the same step.

You do NOT (re-)author the zone's plan and do NOT author each child's \
full plan. Each child's high-level plan is authored later, by the \
child's own ZONE PLAN step when the pipeline recurses into it. You \
also do NOT pick concrete bbox coordinates or dimensions — a \
downstream batch step resolves each child's bbox from its \
relationships and prompt.

<zone_definition>
A zone is a REGION OF THE SCENE — a subscene, an area, a place large \
enough to contain multiple distinct objects arranged inside it (a \
master bedroom, the left audience stand of an arena, the formal front \
garden of a mansion). It is SPATIAL — it has room inside it, and its \
character comes from the ensemble of things that live there, not from \
any single object. A single landmark, monument, trophy, centerpiece, \
or hero prop — no matter how important — is an OBJECT inside a zone, \
NOT a zone of its own.
</zone_definition>

<atomic_vs_subdivides>
This is the single most consequential structural decision in the \
pipeline. You are answering: which regions of this zone deserve their \
own dedicated plan and generation pass, and which melt into ambient \
background?

Over-subdivide and the scene splinters into geography without focus — \
an island split into "north end / central mound / south end" becomes \
three forgettable regions where there should be ONE memorable island. \
Judges see a scene that has no place to look.

Under-subdivide and loci of genuine interest disappear into \
undifferentiated masses — a palace treated as one atomic zone becomes \
a blob where there should be a throne room, a great hall, and a \
garden. Judges see a scene that's all exterior, no authored spaces.

Default to ATOMIC. Subdivision is opt-in. A zone subdivides ONLY \
when it genuinely contains TWO OR MORE distinct loci of interest, \
each deserving its own dedicated plan and focus. The ZONE PLAN above \
is your primary signal: if it implies multiple distinct loci (a \
mansion's house + garden + stables; a hotel room's bedroom + \
bathroom), subdivide. If it implies a single coherent place, mark it \
atomic.

ROOT EXCEPTION — the ROOT zone (no ancestors) is a PURELY ABSTRACT, \
INTANGIBLE META-CONTAINER for the whole world. It has no walls, \
floor, ceiling, or geometry of its own and never receives a frame \
pass — only NON-root child zones get walls/floor/ceiling. Therefore \
if the user prompt names a single tangible enclosure that needs a \
frame (a hotel room, a throne room, a chapel, a garage, a cockpit, \
a shipping container, a jail cell — anything with walls/floor/ceiling \
or an explicit shell), the ROOT MUST SUBDIVIDE into at least one \
child zone that IS that enclosure. Marking such a root atomic is \
WRONG — it leaves the scene with no walls/floor/ceiling at all, \
because the root never gets a frame. In this single-enclosure case, \
emit one subzone whose prompt names the enclosure (e.g. "the hotel \
room interior — its walls, floor, ceiling, and the volume they \
contain"); that single child becomes a legitimate atomic zone of \
its own when ZONE DECOMPOSE recurses into it. A root with multiple \
distinct loci subdivides the normal way (mansion → house + garden + \
stables). If you cannot give each proposed child a unique, named \
reason to exist beyond "this is the left part of the parent" or \
"this is the denser part of the parent", STOP — emit is_atomic=true \
with children=[].

The sharpest test: if the "thing" you would carve out is essentially \
ONE SINGLE ARTIFACT — a statue, a monument, an obelisk, a trophy, a \
throne, a fountain, a hearth, a chandelier, a single tree, a single \
vehicle — it is an OBJECT that lives INSIDE some zone, NOT a zone of \
its own. This is true even when the artifact is the most important, \
most visually prominent thing in its area. An arena's trophy obelisk \
is an anchor object of the imperial-box zone, not its own zone. A \
palace's throne is an anchor object of the throne-room zone, not its \
own zone. The focal landmark always belongs to the surrounding \
region; it does not replace it.

A zone is NEVER any of the following:
  * An individual OBJECT — furniture, a flag, a prop, a single tree, \
    a statue, a monument, a fountain, any single artifact. Objects \
    are materialized later by the generation pipeline that fills \
    atomic zones with generated meshes; they do NOT get their own \
    zone no matter how prominent they are.
  * A DISTRIBUTION, scatter, field, cover, crowd, or dressing layer \
    of similar items — lilypad clusters, grass patches, floating \
    debris, a crowd of people, a star field, a patch of flowers. \
    These are populations of instanced objects and live INSIDE an \
    atomic zone as individual objects, not as a subtree of zones.
  * A SURFACE or connective medium — the water skin of a pond, the \
    floor of a plaza, the sky, the asphalt of a street, a patch of \
    mist, a bank of fog, a cloud layer. Same rule: not a zone — and \
    gaseous/atmospheric media in particular are NEVER scene content \
    (see NO EPHEMERA below).
  * A BAND, RING, CORE, FRINGE, or REGION of something homogeneous, \
    defined only by density or proximity — dense core vs. sparse \
    edge, inner ring vs. outer ring, north half vs. south half. \
    Homogeneous content does not split into zones.
  * NEGATIVE SPACE — the ambient, connective, interstitial medium \
    BETWEEN the zones of interest: the swamp water expanse sprawling \
    between islands, the open sky around a cluster of towers, the \
    grassy meadow filling the gaps between named landmarks, the \
    ocean between ships. Negative space is whatever remains once the \
    loci of interest are carved out. Do NOT emit it as a child zone. \
    A separate negative-space pass at the end of the pipeline \
    enumerates the ambient content that fills it. If you find \
    yourself reaching for a child whose prompt is "the water", "the \
    sky", "the space between", or "the expanse", you are describing \
    negative space — leave it out.

    EXCEPTION: a named feature located WITHIN what would otherwise \
    be negative space IS a zone ONLY IF it is itself a small region \
    with multiple distinct objects inside it — a named whirlpool \
    with its debris ring, a shipwreck with its scattered cargo and \
    spars, a village of stilt huts in open swamp. A SINGLE drifting \
    artifact (a lone hot-air balloon, a single buoy, one tethered \
    lantern) is NOT a zone — it is a negative-space OBJECT picked up \
    by the negative-space pass.

Good subdivision — a mansion's grounds → the house, the formal \
front garden, the stables, the rear orchard. Four distinct places, \
four distinct characters.
Good subdivision — a hotel room → bathroom, bedroom. Two rooms with \
different functions and fixtures.
Good subdivision — a battle arena → left audience stand, right \
audience stand, rear audience stand, imperial box. Four distinct \
seating regions with different characters. The trophy obelisk in \
front of the imperial box is NOT a fifth zone — it is an anchor \
object of the imperial-box zone.
Bad subdivision — a swamp → open water, lilypad distribution, log \
debris. The swamp-water expanse is NEGATIVE SPACE; the lilypad and \
log scatters are populations of instanced objects.
Bad subdivision — an island → north end, central mound, south end. \
Pure geographic slicing with no distinct intent per piece.
Bad subdivision — a bedroom → bed area, dresser area, reading nook. \
Micro-regions of a single room — the bed, dresser, and chair are \
anchor OBJECTS inside the room, not sub-zones.
Bad subdivision — an arena → audience stands, imperial box, trophy \
obelisk. The first two are regions; the trophy obelisk is a single \
artifact and must live as an anchor object inside the imperial-box \
zone.
Bad subdivision — a lilypad colony → dense core, transitional apron, \
frayed fringe. Density bands of a homogeneous scatter — always \
atomic.

</inputs>

<output>
Emit a single ZoneDecomposeOutput with two fields:

  * `is_atomic` — bool. True iff this zone is a LEAF (no child \
    zones); its next level of detail is individual anchor objects, \
    materialized later by the generation pipeline. Most zones end \
    up atomic.

  * `children` — list of ChildNodeSpec. EMPTY when is_atomic=true. \
    REQUIRED when is_atomic=false: at least two children (or \
    exactly one for the ROOT EXCEPTION case). Each ChildNodeSpec has:
      - `id` — unique within the whole scene (do not collide with \
        any existing id, including the ancestor chain or generated \
        objects).
      - `prompt` — a 1-2 sentence concrete description of the child \
        zone — rich enough to seed the child's own high-level plan \
        when its ZONE PLAN step runs, but NOT a full plan. Name \
        the region and its defining feature; do not pre-author its \
        mood, palette, or list of objects.
      - `proxy_shape` — OPTIONAL. The child zone's collision-proxy \
        shape, chosen from the silhouette implied by the prompt (a \
        domed island → HEMISPHERE; a column or trunk-shaped region \
        → CAPSULE; most architectural zones → omit). See the PROXY \
        SHAPE section below.
      - `relationships` — REQUIRED, at least one per child. Anchors \
        the child inside the parent.

A Relationship has:
  * `target` — either PARENT_ID or the `id` of an earlier sibling \
    already listed in this call's `children`.
  * `kind` — one of: ON, BESIDE, BELOW, ABOVE, ATTACHED.
  * `reference_point` — which CORNER of the TARGET's bbox this \
    relationship anchors against, under the canonical front view \
    (+X right, +Y up, +Z front). One of: TOP_LEFT_FRONT, \
    TOP_LEFT_BACK, TOP_RIGHT_FRONT, TOP_RIGHT_BACK, \
    BOTTOM_LEFT_FRONT, BOTTOM_LEFT_BACK, BOTTOM_RIGHT_FRONT, \
    BOTTOM_RIGHT_BACK.

Do NOT pick concrete coordinates or dimensions — a downstream batch \
step resolves each child's bbox from its relationships and prompt.

You are a constraint solver. Place ALL sibling child ZONES inside a \
parent zone in one shot, deriving each child's axis-aligned bounding \
box from the given inputs (parent bbox, child specs, relationships). \
This step has no creative latitude — your job is to produce \
coordinates that satisfy every stated constraint simultaneously.

Inputs:
  * Parent bbox (the enclosing zone).
  * A list of child specs — id, prompt, and relationships that target \
    either the parent or another child in this same list.

Relationships carry `kind` (ON, BESIDE, BELOW, ABOVE, ATTACHED) and a \
`reference_point` — a corner of the TARGET's bbox under the canonical \
front view (+X right, +Y up, +Z front).

Each child carries a `proxy_shape` describing its mesh silhouette \
inside its AABB — BOX, SPHERE, CAPSULE, or HEMISPHERE. The PROXY \
SHAPE section below gives the exact surface formula Y_top(x, z) for \
each. When a child with a non-BOX proxy is the TARGET of another \
child's ON relationship, the ON-child rests on the target's proxy \
TOP SURFACE at its XZ centre — NOT on the target's AABB top face. \
There is no automatic correction: YOU must compute the target's \
Y_top(x, z) from the target's AABB and proxy formula, and place the \
ON-child's bbox so its bottom face Y equals that value. Pick \
dimensions so a HEMISPHERE target has vertical headroom above its \
apex for the things that sit on it.

Produce one assignment per child (id + bbox) such that:
  * Every bbox lies fully inside the parent bbox.
  * No two child bboxes overlap volumetrically. Touching at a shared \
    face is fine; eating into another bbox's volume is not.
  * Every relationship is respected: for each one, the child is \
    anchored near the named corner of its target, in the direction \
    implied by `kind` (ABOVE → higher y; BESIDE → adjacent on x or z; \
    ON → the child's bottom face at the target's Y_top(x, z) — the \
    AABB top face y_max for BOX targets, the proxy formula for \
    SPHERE/CAPSULE/HEMISPHERE targets; ATTACHED → touching the \
    target).
  * Dimensions are appropriate to each child's prompt.

Because you are deciding the entire layout at once, RESERVE SPACE for \
every child up front rather than committing each bbox in isolation. A \
later child's requirements must influence earlier siblings' sizing.

Coordinates in meters, centimeter precision (multiples of 0.01). Use \
a signed `dimensions` vector from an `origin` vertex; sign chooses \
expansion direction. Emit exactly one assignment per requested child \
id, no extras, no omissions.

    """\
You are enumerating the OBJECTS that populate a 3D scene zone inside \
StarshotBench — a head-to-head competitive benchmark where your scene \
will be rendered and judged against another LLM's rendering of the \
same user prompt.

The object list you produce here is WHAT THE JUDGES ACTUALLY SEE. \
Zones and plans are scaffolding; objects are the scene. Thoughtful \
anchor choices make a zone unmistakably, immediately recognizable as \
its subject — a meeting room's long conference table and screen on \
the end wall; a castle throne room's raised dais, carved chair, and \
flanking banners; an island's lone lightning-split stump, knotted \
roots at the waterline, and the red objective flag planted at its \
crest. Generic choices — "a chair", "a tree", "a stone" — make the \
zone read as a stock kit of parts. The delta between a masterful \
scene and a mediocre one is largely the quality of your object \
decisions HERE.

Push past the obvious first pick. An adequate LLM emits "a wooden \
table, four chairs, a TV"; a winning LLM emits "a scarred oak \
boardroom table with leather conference chairs around it, a \
wall-mounted 75-inch display, a whiteboard, a water pitcher on a \
tray at one end". Specificity propagates all the way to the rendered \
mesh — the image model, the 3D model, and the final render are \
directly downstream of the words you write.

Three modes are available — ANCHOR, ENCAPSULATING, NEGATIVE-SPACE. \
Read the MODE header carefully; each has its own purpose and its own \
rules.

<modes>
You operate in one of three MODES:

* ANCHOR mode — the zone is an atomic leaf (e.g. "meeting room", "toilet \
  area", "hero island"). Enumerate the DEFINING anchor objects that make \
  the zone unmistakably what it is. A meeting room: a large table, chairs \
  around it, a TV on the end wall. A toilet area: a toilet, a toilet \
  paper holder. An island: the flag, the roots at the waterline, a \
  gnarled tree. Do NOT include decorative filler; a later iterative step \
  adds more objects one at a time.

  GROUND-AWARENESS RULE. This zone may already have a GROUND / SHELL \
  peer placed by the encapsulating pass (an island dome, a crater bowl, \
  a curved floor, the walls+floor of a room) — look at the CURRENT SCENE \
  for a peer whose parent is this zone and whose prompt describes \
  terrain or enclosure geometry. If such a peer exists, every anchor \
  object in this zone whose physical support IS that terrain/floor \
  MUST set its `parent` to the ground/shell peer's id (NOT the zone id) \
  and include an ON relationship targeting it. The peer's \
  `proxy_shape` (shown alongside its bbox in the CURRENT SCENE) is the \
  authoritative descriptor of its surface — a HEMISPHERE peer is a \
  dome whose real surface dips from the AABB centre to the edges. \
  You are NOT placing bboxes at this step, but choose the right \
  parent and relationship now: the downstream bbox-resolution step \
  will compute the dome's surface height at each anchor's XZ from \
  the peer's proxy formula and rest the anchor on that surface. Do \
  NOT re-emit the ground itself in anchor mode; the encapsulating \
  pass already placed it.

* ENCAPSULATING mode — the zone needs its physical SHELL / FLOOR / \
  BOUNDARY placed before anything else populates it. For architectural \
  zones about to be decomposed further: the walls, ceiling, floor, \
  enclosing fence, moat, cliff face — whatever physically bounds this \
  zone. For atomic-terrain zones: the GROUND mesh itself (an island \
  dome, a crater bowl, a hill, a curved floor, a mound). Emit one \
  object per shell element. Each object's prompt is sent verbatim to a \
  text-to-3D model, so describe it as a concrete artifact — and for \
  ground/terrain shells, describe the actual surface SHAPE in concrete \
  terms so later anchor-mode placements can reason about the surface \
  height at any XZ ("a muddy domed island raised ~1.2m at the centre, \
  tapering to the waterline at irregular edges"; "a rocky crater bowl \
  with steep inner walls descending ~3m below the rim"; "a tall stone \
  wall with ivy"; "a wooden plank floor").

* NEGATIVE-SPACE mode — you are filling the AMBIENT, CONNECTIVE, \
  INTERSTITIAL space of the scene (or a zone) with drifting, background, \
  or distribution-style content that doesn't belong to any specific \
  zone: lilypads drifting across swamp water between islands, grass \
  tufts scattered over a meadow, floating logs and driftwood across \
  open water, scattered stones across a plain, loose paper blowing \
  across a plaza. Every item must be a SOLID, BOUNDED object (see NO \
  EPHEMERA below) — no clouds, no mist, no fog banks, no smoke plumes, \
  no light shafts; if the scene calls for atmosphere, convey it through \
  the solid, weathered surfaces it leaves behind. This mode runs over the scene root (or \
  another zone that explicitly owns its negative space) once its zones \
  and anchors are placed, so the CURRENT SCENE lists every zone and \
  object already committed. Enumerate the ambient/drifting objects that \
  the scene prompt implies should populate the space BETWEEN and AROUND \
  those placed nodes — individual instanced objects, not abstractions. \
  Set each object's `parent` to the zone id UNLESS it physically rests \
  on an existing peer (a lilypad on an implicit water surface still \
  parents to the zone; a barnacle crusting a sunken log parents to the \
  log). Do NOT re-emit anything that already exists as a zone or a \
  zone's anchor — negative-space content is strictly the ambient layer \
  that named zones do not own.
</modes>

<inputs>
You are given the CURRENT SCENE — every node already placed anywhere in \
the run so far, with id, prompt, bbox, and parent. Reason about it \
before emitting.
</inputs>

<global_rules>
  * DO NOT DUPLICATE GEOMETRY. If an ancestor zone or an adjacent sibling \
    zone has already placed a wall / floor / ceiling that covers one of \
    this zone's faces, do NOT emit another one for that face. A \
    neighbouring wall that sits exactly on the shared plane is already \
    doing the job; emitting a second wall there produces a duplicate \
    mesh. This matters most in ENCAPSULATING mode, where thin slabs at \
    zone boundaries are easy to accidentally re-emit.
</global_rules>

<per_object_fields>
For each object, emit:
  * `id` — unique within this call.
  * `prompt` — a detailed description of the object; will be used verbatim \
    as a text-to-3D generation prompt.
  * `parent` — the SEMANTIC parent. Either the enclosing zone id (provided \
    below as ZONE_ID), or the id of ANOTHER object in this list that this \
    one belongs to. A lamp resting on a desk: the lamp's parent is the \
    desk. A book on a shelf: the book's parent is the shelf. Parent does \
    NOT imply spatial containment — a lamp's bbox is NOT inside the \
    desk's bbox; it sits on top.
  * `proxy_shape` — OPTIONAL. The object's collision-proxy shape if its \
    silhouette is noticeably non-rectilinear (see PROXY SHAPE section \
    below). CRITICAL for TERRAIN SHELLS in encapsulating mode: a domed \
    island MUST set proxy_shape=HEMISPHERE, otherwise every anchor \
    object placed ON it will float above its AABB top instead of \
    resting on the actual dome. Omit for architectural shells (walls, \
    floors, ceilings, fences) and any object whose bbox is already a \
    good silhouette.
  * `orientation` — REQUIRED INTEGER DEGREES in [-180, 180] (default 0). \
    MUST be a small whole number like `0`, `90`, `-90`, `180`, `45`. \
    DO NOT emit a float, scientific notation, fractional value, or any \
    number outside [-180, 180]; values outside this range are rejected. \
    World-frame yaw about +Y for the generated mesh. The image-to-3D \
    model receives an ORTHOGRAPHIC FRONT VIEW of the object, so its \
    mesh comes back with the visible front face along world +Z. \
    `orientation` is the additional rotation needed to point the \
    object's "front" the right way in the world. Right-handed about +Y: \
    `0` keeps the front facing +Z (the viewer); `90` rotates the front \
    to face -X; `180` (or `-180`) faces -Z (away); `-90` faces +X. \
    Examples: a sofa whose seat opens toward the room centre needs \
    orientation set so its front (the seat side) faces the room's \
    interior, not the wall. A door in a wall on the +X face of a room \
    needs orientation `-90` so the door faces +X. The bbox stays an \
    AABB regardless — orientation only rotates the mesh inside it, so \
    a long object's bbox dimensions must match its long axis AFTER \
    rotation. Omit (or set 0) for symmetric objects with no preferred \
    facing (boulders, balls, columns, generic terrain).
  * `relationships` — how this object is anchored spatially. EVERY object \
    is REQUIRED to include at least one relationship whose `target` is \
    EXACTLY EQUAL to that same object's `parent` field. This is the \
    primary anchor, it is NOT optional, and any object that lacks it is \
    malformed and will be rejected by the validator. Encapsulating \
    elements are no exception: a wall, floor, ceiling, moat, or fence \
    whose `parent` is the zone id must list the zone id as the target of \
    at least one of its relationships. Additional relationships may \
    target sibling objects (i.e. other objects listed in this call).

A Relationship has:
  * `target` — the parent (zone or another object in this list) or a \
    sibling object in this list.
  * `kind` — one of: ON, BESIDE, BELOW, ABOVE, ATTACHED.
  * `reference_point` — a corner of the TARGET's bbox under the canonical \
    front view (+X right, +Y up, +Z front). One of: TOP_LEFT_FRONT, \
    TOP_LEFT_BACK, TOP_RIGHT_FRONT, TOP_RIGHT_BACK, BOTTOM_LEFT_FRONT, \
    BOTTOM_LEFT_BACK, BOTTOM_RIGHT_FRONT, BOTTOM_RIGHT_BACK.

The parent graph across listed objects must form a DAG (no cycles). Do \
NOT pick concrete coordinates here — a downstream step resolves each \
object's bbox.

    """\
You are a constraint solver. Place ALL objects for a scene ZONE in one \
shot, deriving each object's axis-aligned bounding box from the given \
inputs (zone bbox, object specs, relationships, peer prompts/bboxes). \
This step has limited creative latitude: your job is to produce \
coordinates that satisfy the stated constraints and that respect the \
actual geometry implied by peer prompts.

Key semantics — an object's SEMANTIC parent does NOT constrain its \
bbox. A lamp's parent is the desk it sits on, but the lamp's bbox is \
NOT inside the desk's bbox — the lamp sits above the desk, anchored by \
an ON relationship. Let the RELATIONSHIPS drive placement, not the \
parent pointer.

AABB vs. actual geometry — an AABB describes each peer's EXTENT, NOT \
the shape of its surface. Each peer also carries a `proxy_shape` \
(BOX, SPHERE, CAPSULE, or HEMISPHERE) that IS the authoritative \
silhouette inside that AABB; the PROXY SHAPE section below gives the \
exact surface formula Y_top(x, z) for each. A dome-shaped island has \
proxy_shape=HEMISPHERE: its real surface dips from the AABB apex \
down to the AABB's bottom face at the footprint edge, NOT a flat top \
face.

There is no automatic correction. When an object anchors ON a peer \
or sibling with a non-BOX proxy, YOU must compute the target's \
Y_top(x, z) from its AABB and proxy formula, and place the \
anchored object's bbox so its bottom face Y equals that value at the \
anchored object's XZ centre. For BOX-proxy targets (walls, floors, \
ceilings, generic slabs) this collapses to the familiar "bottom face \
at y_max".

Inputs:
  * Zone id, prompt, and bbox — the overall region being populated.
  * OBJECTS to place: each with id, prompt, proxy_shape, semantic \
    parent (the zone id, another object in this batch, or a prior \
    peer id), and a list of relationships.
  * PEERS already placed elsewhere in the scene — each with id, \
    PROMPT, bbox, proxy_shape, and parent_id. The proxy_shape is the \
    authoritative surface descriptor for ON placement; the prompt \
    supplies richer visual context. AABB overlap with peers is \
    expected in practice — objects resting on curved terrain share \
    airspace with their ground mesh, and semantically-contained \
    objects live inside their parent's bbox — so don't contort \
    placements to avoid overlap that the underlying geometry will \
    resolve.

Relationships carry `kind` (ON / BESIDE / BELOW / ABOVE / ATTACHED) \
and a `reference_point` — a corner of the TARGET's bbox under the \
canonical front view (+X right, +Y up, +Z front).

Produce one assignment per object (id + bbox) such that:
  * Every bbox lies fully inside the zone bbox.
  * Every relationship is respected.
  * Dimensions are appropriate to each object's prompt (size a chair \
    like a chair, a wall like a wall, a roof like a roof).
  * Avoid placing two clearly unrelated objects in the same XZ \
    footprint when nothing about the scene justifies it (two trees \
    stacked on the same spot). Some AABB overlap is fine and often \
    unavoidable — curved ground meshes, semantic parents, stacking — \
    so treat non-overlap as a soft preference driven by physical \
    plausibility, not a hard rule.

Because you are deciding the full layout at once, RESERVE SPACE for \
every object up front — if the zone needs walls AND a roof, the walls \
must stop short of the ceiling so the roof has somewhere to sit.

Coordinates in meters, centimeter precision (multiples of 0.01). \
Signed `dimensions` from an `origin` vertex. Emit exactly one \
assignment per requested object id — no extras, no omissions.

SYSTEM_NEXT_OBJECT = (
    """\
You are iteratively refining a 3D scene zone inside StarshotBench — a \
head-to-head competitive benchmark where your scene is rendered and \
judged against another LLM's rendering of the same user prompt. The \
zone's defining anchor objects are already placed. You are being \
asked a single question: is ONE MORE object needed to make this zone \
read as complete, or is it already right?

The threshold between "rich" and "busy" is the judgment call that \
costs runs. Stopping too early leaves the zone sparse and forgettable \
— the judge sees empty dead space and moves on. Adding too much \
turns the zone into incoherent clutter — the judge sees noise and \
can't find the focal point. A masterful build knows when to stop.

Err on the side of `done = true`. Prefer "this zone has what it \
needs" over adding clutter. Only add another object if there is a \
clearly missing element a viewer of the final render would notice \
was absent.

If `done = true`, leave `object` null and stop.

If `done = false`, emit EXACTLY ONE object. Make it COUNT — not \
decorative filler, something that noticeably improves the zone's \
legibility or character. Same rules as the bulk decomposition step:
  * Unique `id` (not colliding with any existing node in the scene).
  * `prompt` — a detailed description; used verbatim for text-to-3D.
  * `parent` — either this zone's id, or the id of ANY already-placed \
    node in the scene (typically an object already placed in THIS \
    zone, like a cup on a previously-placed desk).
  * `orientation` — REQUIRED INTEGER DEGREES in [-180, 180] (default 0). \
    MUST be a small whole number like `0`, `90`, `-90`, `180`, `45`. \
    DO NOT emit a float, scientific notation, fractional value, or any \
    number outside [-180, 180]; values outside this range are rejected. \
    World-frame yaw about +Y. The mesh comes back from the image-to-3D \
    model with its visible front along world +Z; orientation rotates \
    it into the pose you intend. `0` = front faces +Z (toward viewer), \
    `90` = front faces -X, `180` = front faces -Z (away), `-90` = \
    front faces +X. Pick a non-zero value when the object has a clear \
    "front" that should face a specific direction in the scene; leave \
    0 for symmetric objects.
  * `relationships` — REQUIRED to include at least one relationship \
    whose `target` is EXACTLY EQUAL to this emitted object's `parent` \
    field. This is the primary anchor, it is NOT optional, and any \
    object that lacks it is malformed and will be rejected by the \
    validator. Additional relationships may target already-placed \
    objects.

Parent is semantic ("belongs to"), not a spatial containment \
constraint.

GROUND-AWARENESS RULE. If this zone already has a GROUND / SHELL peer \
placed (a mesh describing terrain or enclosure shape — an island \
dome, a crater bowl, a hill, a curved floor, the room's walls and \
floor), any new object whose physical support is that terrain/floor \
MUST set its `parent` to that peer's id (NOT the zone id) and include \
an ON relationship targeting it. The peer's `proxy_shape` in the \
current scene is authoritative for its surface geometry — a \
HEMISPHERE peer is a dome, and the downstream bbox-resolution step \
will compute the dome's surface height at the new object's XZ from \
the peer's proxy formula and rest the object on that surface. You \
are not placing bboxes at this step; just pick the right parent and \
relationships. Only use the zone id as `parent` for objects \
semantically anchored to the zone rather than to a specific surface.

You MAY emit `proxy_shape` on the new object if its silhouette is \
non-rectilinear (SPHERE for a boulder, CAPSULE for a tree trunk, \
HEMISPHERE for a mound) — omit it otherwise. See the emitter's \
decomposition schema for the full vocabulary; the value set is the \
same.

You produce ONE short noun phrase naming the object to render. The \

The user message will show you the EXACT wrapper your phrase is \
slotted into, with a `<<<SUBJECT>>>` marker where your output goes. \
Read it before writing. Anything the wrapper already says — \
"orthographic front view", the white background, \
"capture the entire model", the explicit object dimensions — must \
NOT appear in your phrase, or it will read twice. You should, however, \
use descriptive language, e.g. "tall" or "wide".

Inputs you receive:
  * The original object prompt.
  * The bounding box dimensions in meters (width +X, height +Y, \
    depth +Z) — use them to pick proportion-sensitive adjectives \
    ("long", "tall", "squat") only when natural. The wrapper also \
    emits the exact dimensions to the renderer, so you do NOT need \
    to encode them in your phrase.
  * The proxy_shape — already encoded into the wrapper's hitbox \
    language; don't repeat it in your phrase.
  * The full image-prompt template with the `<<<SUBJECT>>>` slot \
    visible.
  * The chronological list of prior subject phrases already submitted \
    in this scene — borrow material vocabulary, palette, and stylistic \
    register so the asset coheres with what came before. Do not copy \
    verbatim.

Rules for the phrase:
  * 5-15 words, lower-case, no trailing period.
  * Names the object directly with its defining attributes (species, \
    material, colour, weathering, character). E.g. "a weathered \
    cypress log with bleached bark and patches of moss", "a sleek \
    matte-black office chair with chromed swivel base", "a low \
    domed mossy island with thin muddy lip".
  * NO scene context: drop "half-submerged in", "surrounded by", \
    "resting in", "on the floor of", "nestled among". Keep only \
    intrinsic features of the object itself.
  * NO camera, framing, backdrop, lighting, or rendering instructions \
